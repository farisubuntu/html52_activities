## The WebVTT format:

- sample vtt file and how to use - example [http://jsbin.com/bewuyuc/4/edit?html,output]
- An unofficial webVTT format validator [https://quuz.org/webvtt/]

### Tools for creating WebVTT subtitles and for reusing existing subtitles
 - Tools for converting existing file formats to  WebVTT files, such as the .srt format, 
 which is popular in the DivX/AVI/Mkv scene. This article
  [http://thenewcode.com/584/Creating-And-Validating-WebVTT-Subtitles] reviews 3 of them.

 - Tools for creating subtitles/captions from scratch. Use these to generate a WebVTT file.You can embed 
 the `<track>` element in your own videos, on your own Web pages, or upload the WebVTT file to YouTube. 
 We recommend Universal Subtitles. [http://www.universalsubtitles.org] It's a free online tool that 
 is very easy to use. Check the "add subtitles/captions to your video" unit of this course. 

 - Enhanced HTML5 video players that use the `<video>`, `<source>` and `<track>` elements under the hood.
  They also provide many extra features, including support for subtitle/caption formats other
   than WebVTT (by converting on the fly).

 - JavaScript libraries for converting to the WebVTT format on the fly,
  such as JS_videosub [http://www.storiesinflight.com/js_videosub/]
